Notes:

-Translations are super useful, we can get any text with string = Tr("KEY") from csv file;
-So our CSV file should basically contain every line we want said.
-So when we write our dialogue, we don't need to even think about the line, just the KEY.
-The KEY will be called when we do Tr("KEY").
-Our dictionary thus, will need a KEY

//Next Steps:
//Player, Companion, and Save Data: time to change Companion.cs to Save.cs and Save.res in a good directory.
//Note: in save.res, Companion's data will *already* be initialized. We don't have to re-set all data to zero and can skip if not using it.
//After that, let's play with bigger text, and then move on to the battle.
//Once battle is outlined, we have enough of a foundation to form the rest without too much issue.

-Trigger->Set to battle scene. (Done)
-Who is fighting? ->Get Data for Team Player. (Done)
-Who are we fighting against?->Generate Data for Team Enemy. (Done)

Image and Positioning stuff:
	//TextureButton _sprite = new TextureButton(); // Create a new Sprite.
	//AddChild(_sprite);
	//var texture = new ImageTexture();
	//var image = GD.Load("res://godot.png");
	
	

//_sprite.TextureNormal = (Texture) image;

//var position_vector = new Vector2(1200,23);
//_sprite.SetPosition(position_vector);

var enemy = GetNode<VBoxContainer>("EnemyTeam");
	//GD.Print(enemy.GetChildren());
	var child = (Control)enemy.GetChild(0);

//*Game  Design*//
//Difficulty 
Lonewolf->remove.
*We want to keep the theme of two. While one person's personality is carveable, the other one is set by the game.
*instead:
->Tier1/Story: The player and their companion can never die. The execution defeat scenario will never play, always ensuring the player will be a survivor. 
->Tier2/Standard: Balanced around this. No alterations to game rules.
->Tier3/Strategist: Enemies are much less likely to play other defeat scenarios except execution. A.I. is crueler.
Optional: Merciless Mode: One life. On death, the save is deleted. Only available for standard/strategist difficulties.

//Companion Relationships:
->Sibling->Shares the Hart survivor background. Must be human. Summer Kingdom originate
->Childhood Friend->Child of the guardian. Cannot be human. Spring Kingdom originate. Loses their parent at the start of the story.
->Stranger: Part of a group vowed to protect the player. From the Autumn Kingdom.
->Enemy: Part of a group hired to kill the player. Their leader's indiscriminate killing has them turn against their organization. Part of the Winter Kingdom.
